## SOA Movie API - Omar Aiyyachi
In it, I'm going to explain to you how to set up and use this API. The API itself is written in NodeJS in the framework ExpressJS. This gives you the ability to start a lightweight server. SwaggerUI is what I used to document the API.
## Database
Our group decided to set up a PostgreSQL database and we also host it ourselves. 
For more info on database credentials.

     File: ./constants.js
## Setup
Setup is very simple, after you have cloned the repository. Run the command: 

     npm install

Next, to start the application, run the command:

     npm start
  
## API Documentation
The documentation was created using the library SwaggerUI. This is an easy way to document your API, as you have the freedom to test the API and see what you get as a result.
Eens de applicatie is gestart, kan je naar de volgende link navigeren om te zien wat je allemaal kan doen met de API: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs/](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/)
